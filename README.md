# Hi there 👋

I am Cameron Justilien and I am currently studing web development in college.

## About Me
My goal is to better myself when it comes to creating programs and websites. I know that it is not going to be easy, but I am willing to take on the challenge.
Part of the reason why I want to be a professional programmer is because I find coding satisfying when I understand concepts a code the right way.
I also like coding because I like coding my own games and using those games as a learning experience to get better.
